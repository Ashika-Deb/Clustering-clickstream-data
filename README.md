# Unveiling patterns: Evaluating Clustering Algorithms for Enhanced Understanding of E-Commerce Clickstream Behaviour

In the era of big data, the need for efficient data analysis has become paramount. Customer segmentation is a crucial technique in the realm of business and marketing as it allows organizations to gain a nuanced understanding of their diverse customer base. Rather than treating all customers as a homogeneous group, segmentation involves categorizing them into distinct segments based on shared characteristics, behaviours, or preferences. Based on data extracted after customer pattern analysis, businesses can enhance the relevance of their communication, increasing the likelihood of resonating with customers. 

This project aims to address the challenges associated with data clustering, offering insights into the strengths and weaknesses of various algorithms.  In contemporary data science and machine learning, clustering plays a pivotal role in uncovering patterns, grouping similar data points, and facilitating better decision-making. With numerous clustering algorithms available it becomes imperative to understand their comparative performance. This project seeks to provide a comprehensive evaluation of popular clustering algorithms, aiding practitioners, researchers, and data scientists in selecting the most appropriate algorithm based on specific use cases.

The primary objective is to conduct a thorough comparative analysis of selected clustering algorithms, including K-Means, Hierarchical Clustering, DBSCAN, Agglomerative Clustering, Fuzzy C-Means, and more. The study aims to explore how these algorithms perform on the clickstream dataset by delving into the strengths, weaknesses, and application scenarios of each algorithm. The project will be carried out in python.

The study will utilize an e-commerce websiteâ€™s clickstream dataset. The dataset contains information on clickstream from online store offering clothing for pregnant women. Data are from five months of 2008 and include, among others, product category, location of the photo on the page, country of origin of the IP address and product price in US dollars. There are 14 features and 165474 instances and has been provided by the UCI Machine Learning Repository. 

The research methodology involves the practical implementation of selected clustering algorithms on the chosen datasets. Parameters such as the number of clusters, distance metrics, and algorithm-specific parameters will be systematically varied to observe their impact on clustering results. Performance metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score, will be employed to quantitatively assess the algorithms. Additionally, qualitative analysis, such as visualization of clustering outputs, will complement the quantitative evaluation. The project aims to identify scenarios where specific algorithms excel and others may struggle, providing valuable guidance for practitioners.
